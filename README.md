# xGamebook
Prototype "gamebook" (choose-your-own-adventure) implementation.

## Overview

Every once in a while, I have a quick idea for a project that requires some sort of narrative with user input that isn't quite [Interactive Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) (where I would probably just use [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/) to try it out), but also isn't something I can envision as [Hypertext fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_fiction).  What can I say?  I spent a lot of formative years playing tabletop roleplaying games and still have some ideas rattling around my skull.

Speaking of games, I wouldn't be surprised to find this eventually married to something like [AC-Resolve](https://github.com/jcolag/AC-Resolve) in the future.
